            <p>You have identified the need for a new digital service, or a replacement of a legacy service. The solution needs to meet the needs of your organisation, its stakeholders and its users. But within your organisation, you donâ€™t have all the skills or experience needed to engage with stakeholders and users. Nor do you have all the skills to be able to design, develop and deliver digital services.</p>

            <p>You want your service to be delivered in a timely fashion, and to meet all of the many standards of accessibility, security and reliability.</p>
