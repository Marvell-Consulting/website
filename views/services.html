            <h2>Discover</h2>

            <p>Understanding your users’ need is the starting point for building any successful service. Research provides the insight to make sound, evidence-based decisions.</p>

            <p>We’ll work with you to understand who your users are and how best to involve them in the development of your service or product. That could be a full discovery where we explore all the people, systems and processes impacted by a digital change. Or it could be shadowing users to see how easy (or hard) they find a proposed new system.</p>

            <p>We use a range of methods depending on the project including stakeholder workshops, workplace observations and usability testing. When researching with stakeholders we’re sensitive to differences in organisational norms and cultures and take time to understand how best to engage them to build their trust. </p>

            <p>All our researchers are accredited, GDPR compliant and practised in applying best practice, ethical methods of research.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>

            <p>Well-designed products and services combine insights about users with organisational knowledge, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of core design principles. </p>

            <p>We use methods including service mapping, co-design workshops and prototyping to explore how technology could meet users’ needs in the simplest and most sustainable way possible. We’re also mindful of constraints and engage with stakeholders early on to ensure approaches are technically and operationally feasible. </p>

            <p>It’s no coincidence that some of the most successful technologies are also the easiest to use. Clear wording, simple interfaces and design that’s accessible by default are principles that lie at the heart of everything we do. We test all our designs in real life scenarios with real users so we can be confident our products and services are genuinely user-centred and work for everyone. </p>

            <h2>Deliver</h2>

            <p>Secure, resilient, high-performing: digital products and services are only as good as the software they’re built on. </p>

            <p>Our technical discovery starts with identifying where existing products can be used or if bespoke software is required. As champions of open-source software we’re always looking for opportunities to reuse existing solutions to make development faster and more cost-effective. </p>

            <p>Our years of experience handling sensitive data for the public sector means we can deliver software that meets the highest security standards. We also use automated processes as much as possible to increase reliability and responsiveness. </p>

            <p>Work doesn’t stop when a service goes live. We continue to measure service performance so we can make improvements based on real data. One way we do this is by making performance statistics a core service feature, allowing us to spot potential issues before they become problems for our users. Continuous learning and refinement means our services only get better. </p>
