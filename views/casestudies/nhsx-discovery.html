            <h2>The challenge</h2>
           
            <p>In March 2021, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care gave <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/driving-digital-in-the-nhs">a speech about the critical importance technology has played in the coronavirus response</a>. </p>
 
            <p>He highlighted how interoperability - joining up IT systems to allow instant data-sharing - has the potential to transform health and social care.</p>
            
            <p>We were engaged by <a href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/">NHSX</a> to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works">carry out a discovery phase</a> into a possible digital solution that could help move the government closer to its goal. </p>

            <h2>Finding evidence</h2>
            <p>Over 4 weeks we carried out a discovery. Our research aims were to explore:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the different user groups and their role in building, commissioning and enforcing interoperable health tech</li>
                <li>their needs and pain points</li>
                <li>the extent to which NHSX’s proposed standards catalogue would meet their needs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In total we carried out <strong>1700 minutes of research</strong> over <strong>28 sessions with users</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>We used <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery">agile methods to manage the project</a>. Our show and tells focused on telling a strong, clear narrative to help stakeholders unfamiliar with interoperability to understand the problems and opportunities in this space. </p>

            <p>We completed our discovery as scheduled in April 2021. </p>

            <p>We found this is a complex area with a large number of users and unmet user needs. In total we identified around <strong>50 user groups</strong> in this space and over <strong>60 unmet user needs</strong>. </p>

            <p>We also identified 9 problems that need to be solved for interoperability to be achieved. Details can be found in this blog post by NHSX’s Director of Standards and Interoperability. </p>

            <p>Our research also validated that NHSX’s solution is worth exploring in a future <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works">Alpha phase</a>. </p>

            <h2>A clear way forward</h2>

            <p>NHSX now has a rich source of clear evidence with which to inform their overarching strategy.</p>

            <p>To help NHSX move forward we produced:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a user ecosystem map visualising the 50 different user groups and their relationships to one another</li>
                <li>a user needs board with the 60 identified user needs, categorised into themes that can be taken forward in separate work streams</li>
                <li>a list of prioritised user needs to inform the design of the standards catalogue in Alpha</li>
                <li>communication materials to help inform and engage stakeholders</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Feedback from NHSX’s senior leaders has been extremely positive.</p>
