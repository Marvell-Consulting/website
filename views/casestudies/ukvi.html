            <p class="lead-in">An innovative design for a global complaints service increased customer satisfaction from 31% to 63%</p>


            <h2>The challenge</h2>
            <p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-statistics-year-ending-december-2018/summary-of-latest-statistics">over 2.9 million people were granted visas to visit, work, study or live in the UK</a>. To help meet their needs, we were asked to redevelop UKVI’s existing UK complaints service for global rollout within 6 months. </p>
 
            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works">discovery</a> of the end-to-end service, we identified the following problems to solve: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                	40% of complaints were enquires or requests for help rather than complaints
                </li>
                <li>
                	just 30% of people who used the existing service and gave feedback said they were satisfied
                </li>
                <li>
                	submitted complaints often lacked detail, requiring the complaints team to go back for more information
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p class="quote">“I have a problem in processing my application payment for more than a week. I want to cancel the application but I can not find any link to do anything. I am stuck and it is because it is a technical issue.” <span class="citation">Request for help misdirected to the complaints team</span></p>

            <p>Stakeholders were also frustrated that the large number of general enquiries entering the service inflated complaint statistics in management reports.</p>

            <h2>Bringing a fresh perspective</h2>
            <p>We began with a short discovery to gain an understanding of the service’s users. We engaged with 40 internal stakeholders, analysed data from Google Analytics and reviewed 6 months worth of complaints.</p>
            <p>Based on the findings our design team proposed a very different approach from the generic complaints form. They designed a triaging service, posing simple questions which routed users to relevant information on GOV.UK or UKVI’s helpline, with an option to continue making a complaint. 
            </p>

            <p>The complaint form itself was then redesigned to be clearer for users who speak English as a second language and to encourage more informative responses. </p>

            <span class="citation image">Mapping out how users will be triaged in a sub-section of the service</span>
            
            <p>We tested the service by running a selection of real complaints through it and inviting stakeholders to carry out a robust review.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/complain-uk-visas-immigration">new service</a> is clear, easy to use and meets the needs of the department’s customers and case working teams. </p>
            
            <p>Early feedback has shown a substantial increase in customer satisfaction from 31% in 2019 to 63% in 2020. Users no longer have a frustrating online experience compounding their dissatisfaction.</p>
