            <h1>Designing a complaints service to smile about</h1>
            <p class="client">UK government</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-3-4 pure-u-lg-3-4 main">
            <p class="lead-in">A poorly designed complaints service for a major government department was frustrating customers and staff. Our redesigned, user-centred service was released on time and budget. Statistics from the first month of use show a 103% increase in user satisfaction.</p>


            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>A government department needed to refine an existing complaints service for a global rollout within 6 months. Following a short discovery of the end-to-end service, we identified the following problems to solve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                	40% of complaints were enquires or requests for help rather than complaints
                </li>
                <li>
                	just 30% of people who used the existing service and gave feedback said they were satisfied
                </li>
                <li>
                	submitted complaints often lacked detail, requiring the complaints team to go back for more information
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p class="quote">“I have a problem in processing my application payment for more than a week. I want to cancel the application but I can not find any link to do anything. I am stuck and it is because it is a technical issue.” <span class="citation">Enquiry mistakenly sent to the complaints service</span></p>

            <p>Stakeholders were also frustrated that the large number of general enquiries entering the service inflated complaint statistics in management reports.</p>

            <h2>What we did</h2>
            <p>We began with a short discovery to gain an understanding of the service’s users. We engaged with 40 internal stakeholders, analysed data from Google Analytics and reviewed 6 months worth of complaints.</p>
            <p>Based on the findings, our design team proposed a radically different approach from the generic complaints form. They designed a triaging service, posing simple questions which routed users to relevant information on GOV.UK or a helpline, with an option to continue making a complaint. The complaint form itself was then redesigned to elicit more informative responses.</p>
            
            <div><img class="img" src="/public/img/ukvi-flow.jpg" width="100%" alt="User journey flow" /></div>
            
            <p>We tested the service by running a selection of real complaints through it and inviting stakeholders to carry out a robust review.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The new service is clear, easy to use and meets the needs of the department’s customers and case working teams. </p>

            <p>Early feedback has shown a substantial increase in customer satisfaction from the previous service. Users no longer have a frustrating online experience compounding their dissatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The service went live worldwide on time and on budget within 6 months of us starting work. The clients have expressed to us how happy they are with our successful delivery.</p>
