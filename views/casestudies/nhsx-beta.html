            <p class="lead-in">A new directory of data standards for health and social care has given fresh impetus to an important government ambition. 
            </p>

            <h2>The challenge</h2>
 
            <p>In 2021 we completed a <a href="nhsx-discovery">discovery for a new service</a> that could support interoperability, where information flows seamlessly across health IT systems.</p>

            <p>The service would help solve 2 key problems for users: the data standards needed for interoperability are published by multiple organisations making them hard to find; and it can be hard to find important details about those standards in sometimes lengthy documents.</p>
            
            <p>The service would link users to different data standards in use across the health sector from technical specifications to data dictionaries.</p>
            
            <p>At the end of our alpha we had an <a href="nhsx-alpha">initial design</a>. Now we needed to refine the service further and start building it with real data.</p>
             
            <h2>What we did</h2>
            
            <p>First we needed to validate how the directory could be kept up to date which is essential to maintaining users’ trust in the service.</p>
            
            <p>We carried out research with similar services to understand how they had solved this problem. We then put together a strategy detailing how the service could be kept up to date using automated tools, manual checks and user feedback.</p>
            
           <div><img class="img" src="/public/img/nhsxb-updates.png" width="100%" alt="This image shows a line diagram laying out how the directory could be managed, from the point at which it is identified that something in the directory needs updating to the point the update goes live." /></div>
           
           <span class="citation image"> Methods and processes for keeping the directory up to date</span>

            <p>We also advised on governance for the service, including specifying the roles needed to run it and helping set up a group of data experts to oversee the service.</p>

            <p>Finally we started building the live service whilst continuing to make design improvements. This included:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>carrying out over 50 research sessions with users including prototype and live build testing</li>
                <li>working with the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/data-alliance-partnership-board">Data Alliance Partnership Board</a> to add a new feature - the ability to see new standards in development</li>
                <li>continuing to simplify the language to increase understanding of this complex area</li>
            </ul>

             
            <h2>Going live</h2>

            <div><img class="img" src="/public/img/nhsxb-roadmap.png" width="100%" alt="The image shows a page from the data standards directory called roadmap of future requirements in England. The page contains a table of standards that are currently being assessed with a view to mandatory implementation in England. " /></div>

            <span class="citation image">New page showing standards currently in development</span>

            <p>In August 2022 the service went live following a successful NHS service assessment and just one year after completing the discovery. This met the government’s deadline as committed to in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data#developing-the-right-technical-infrastructure">Data Saves Lives: reshaping health and social care with data</a>. </p>

            <p>Stakeholders have been delighted, both by the quality of the work but also what we’ve been able to achieve in such a short time. </p>

            <p>The renewed focus on the area of data standards has prompted activity in other areas and our findings have supported teams working to improve standards development and those working on policy.</p>
