            <p>A regulator’s legacy technology needed replacing with a GDS-compliant system whilst safeguarding business continuity</p>


            <h2>The challenge</h2>

            <p>In 2017, a regulator reached out to us for help replacing their legacy digital system. The system is used by scientists to apply for and manage licences, and by the regulator to grant or refuse those licences.</p>
            
            <p>The existing system, built in 2012, had a number of problems including:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>licence applications were emailed in paper format and staff had to input them by hand</li>
                <li>the system wasn’t optimised for mobile working, a serious drawback for staff doing on site inspections</li>
                <li>the system wasn’t technically robust - work sometimes failed to save </li>
                <li>licences were issued as encrypted PDFs that some people couldn’t open</li>
                <li>the design wasn’t intuitive - users had a steep learning curve to understand how to perform simple tasks</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="quote">

            <p>These problems were reflected in a government assessment, with just 3 out of the 18 original <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a> points being met.</p>

            <h2>Designing the new service </h2>
            
            <p>The contract with the legacy supplier was due to expire in August 2019. Our brief was to replace it with a compliant service with minimal impact to the regulator’s operations.</p>
            
            <p>We started by identifying the highest priority needs. We then carried out rapid development cycles as we researched, designed and tested different features of the new service. In total we held <strong>222 research sessions</strong> over 2 years and <strong>iterated our designs 2 to 3 times</strong> on average. </p>

            <p>Our solution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>digitised and improved the application process, removing the need for manual data entry</li>
                <li>digitised and improved licences, making them easily visible to authorised users </li>
                <li>was more technically robust and designed to support mobile working</li>
                <li>was clear and intuitive for first time users </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Preparing to go public</h2>
            
            <p>The riskiest part of the service involved migrating over 18,000 licence records from the legacy supplier into the new system. </p>
            
            <p>We created a data migration strategy that involved automated and manual checks of the data and data cleansing. A risk report detailed the most serious risks and the mitigating actions we’d take should anything go wrong.</p>
            
            <p>Once the data had been migrated, 15 research establishments with the largest and most complex datasets were invited to check their data in the system before we went live. </p>

            
            <h2>Faster, easier, compliant</h2>

            <p>The new service went live on schedule and the legacy system was turned off. There were no disruptions to the regulator’s operations with the new service going live over the weekend. </p>

            <p>The service <strong>passed 3 government alpha assessments</strong> and is already delivering benefits including: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>a 50% reduction in the number of iterations of draft project licence applications from 4.8 to 2.5, decreasing time and burden on senior staff assessing applications</li>
              <li>a 50% reduction in the time taken by staff to process personal licence applications</li>
            </ul>
