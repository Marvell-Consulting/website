            <p class="lead-in">An innovative open source tool for building GOV.UK forms facilitated faster development in 19 services.</p>


            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>An important change for government in recent years has been transferring paper application forms into forms that people can complete online. </p>
 
            <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/services">There are over 7,500 forms on GOV.UK</a> used for anything from renewing a passport to booking a prison visit. These services need to align to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">government standards</a> and may require common functionality such as uploading files or requesting payment.</p>
            
            <p>Whilst working for a client we identified a need for a simple, cost-effective method of building online government forms. </p>
            
            <p>Previously the only option for government departments was to build a service from scratch. This was time-consuming and expensive. Precious development time was spent re-doing the basics - creating simple pages - rather than tackling new problems. </p>
            
            <p>It also risked inconsistency as departments were reliant on individual teams following standards.</p>
            
            <h2>Creating a reusable tool</h2>
            
            <p>Our lead developer voluntarily took the initiative to build a simple, reusable template that would allow government developers to code front-end services more quickly. He made it accessible and aligned to <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">government patterns and styles</a> by default. </p>
            
            <p>We called it Home Office Forms and made it <a href="https://github.com/UKHomeOfficeForms">available online</a> for anyone to use. We also included <a href="https://ukhomeofficeforms.github.io/hof-guide/documentation/#installing-the-hof-cli">step-by-step guidance</a> to support less experienced developers and created a #hof channel in the <a href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/">UK Government Digital slack channel</a> where anyone could ask us questions. </p>

            <span class="citation image">The software is open source for other services to utilize</span>
            

            <h2>Opening up forms to everyone</h2>

            <p>Government teams can now build simple, working forms in days rather than weeks or months. </p>

            <p>Using the Home Office Forms framework in our services means our developers donâ€™t spend time reinventing the wheel, but can put their skills to good use solving complex problems.</p>

            <span class="citation image">An example flow of questions created using Home Office Forms</span>

            <p>The software is also simple enough that technically-minded designers can start building simple services in code themselves, saving costly development time. </p>

            <p>The tool is being used in 19 services and is so effective Government Digital Service considered rolling it out across the whole of government. </p>
