            <p class="lead-in">A new digital solution for a regulator boosted staff efficiency, and customer satisfaction from 47% to 78%</p>


            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>In 2017, <a href="asru-alpha">we replaced a legacy IT system for a body who licenses scientific research in the UK</a>. After making the system live we were re-commissioned to add additional features.</p>
            
            <p>The initial system allowed scientists to apply for licences online and the regulator to grant or refuse licences. Features requested included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>digitising licence assessment processes</li>
                <li>digitising compliance processes, such as annual reporting used to produce government statistics</li>
                <li>allowing advanced search of licences to support evidence-based policy-making</li>
                <li>creating a dashboard with performance data for managers                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Improving a live service</h2>
            <br>

            <span class="citation image">Running a workshop with stakeholders in the biosciences industry</span>
            
            <p>As the service was live it was important we continued to maintain the core architecture and add new features in ways that weren’t disruptive to users. </p>
            
            <p>Any bugs were reviewed in weekly meetings and prioritised for fixing by the development team. In the meantime the research and design team explored how to incorporate new features into the working software.</p>
            
            <p>In total we carried out <strong>over 270 research sessions</strong> as we designed, tested and iterated the new features before making them live.</p>

            <p>Together with the regulator we agreed a communication strategy to keep licence-holders informed of changes to the system. This included weekly emails and presenting at industry conferences.</p>
            
            
            <p class="quote">"[The regulator] seem to have focused on customer service a lot more in the last two years, they listen to us and ask our views on things. The online service has been a major shift - the change has been expertly managed with lots of clear communications.""

            <span class="citation image">A new feature allowing the regulator to forecast revenues</span>

            
            <p>The new features have given the regulator many benefits, such as being able to see estimated licence fees for the upcoming year or respond more quickly to critical COVID-19 issues, for example by searching for projects that use species thought to spread the virus. It has also been invaluable to staff working from home. </p>

            
            <p class="quote">
              “For us as a business to be able to carry on [during COVID-19] is just incredible...I am not comfortable travelling and I would not have been able to do anything without [the new system] at all.”
              <span class="citation">Inspector, UK regulator</span>
            </p>

            <p>User satisfaction has also increased substantially. A survey of scientific establishments who use the system recently showed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>satisfaction has increased from 47% to 78% – this includes a rise in those very satisfied from 5% to 33%</li>
                <li>confidence in the regulator’s ability to provide an effective service has increased from 77% to 85%  – this includes a rise in those very confident from 15% to 46%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The service is now an exemplar for large-scale digital transformations and features in a <a href="https://services.blog.gov.uk/2021/03/05/showing-the-rewards-of-user-centred-service-design-at-scale/">blog post for the services in government blog</a>. </p>
